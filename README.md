this project uses modern portfolio theory to to stimulate and organise stock portfolios



## **OBJECTIVE**

---


To simulate and identify the most efficient investment portfolio by applying Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) ; maximizing expected return for a given level of risk, or minimizing risk for a target return.

 **CORE ASSUMPTIONS**:

 ---

- Investors are rational and risk-averse.

- Risk can be reduced through diversification — by spreading investments across uncorrelated assets.

**KEY CONCEPTS APPLIED**:

 ---

- **Diversification Principle**: Allocating funds across asset classes (e.g., tech + utilities) helps smooth out volatility. For example, combining a high-growth stock like AAPL with a defensive one like XEL results in a more stable portfolio than holding only tech stocks.

- **Efficient Frontier**: A curve representing the best possible portfolios that offer the highest return for each level of risk.

- **Sharpe Ratio**: The central metric used to assess each portfolio's performance — it measures risk-adjusted return. A higher Sharpe Ratio indicates a more efficient portfolio.


This project simulates 50,000+ portfolio combinations using real historical stock data, visualizes them on a risk-return plot, and identifies the portfolio with the maximum Sharpe Ratio
