# portfolio-optimiser
A Python-powered stock portfolio optimizer based on modern portfolio theory using real-time data, efficient frontier visualization, and Sharpe ratio-based optimization. Built entirely in Colab with zero setup.

This project simulates and optimizes stock portfolios using Python and Modern Portfolio Theory. It fetches real-time stock data, calculates returns, risk, and Sharpe Ratio, and visualizes thousands of random portfolios to identify the most efficient one. The entire analysis is done in Google Colab, making it easy to run and modify without any local setup. Ideal for finance enthusiasts, data analysts, and students looking to add a practical, data-driven finance project to their portfolio.
