# portfolio-optimiser
A Python-powered stock portfolio optimizer based on modern portfolio theory using real-time data, efficient frontier visualization, and Sharpe ratio-based optimization. Built entirely in Colab with zero setup.

This project simulates and optimizes stock portfolios using Python and Modern Portfolio Theory. It fetches real-time stock data, calculates returns, risk, and Sharpe Ratio, and visualizes thousands of random portfolios to identify the most efficient one.
